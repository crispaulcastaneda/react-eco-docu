# Getting started with React-eco-docu

This is a simple side task of understanding react.js environment and its configurations.

## Installation

- Clone this repository `https://github.com/crispaulcastaneda/react-eco-docu.git`
- `cd your-workspace`
- `git clone https://github.com/crispaulcastaneda/react-eco-docu.git`
- `yarn start`

## What is the use of this repository?

To learn the basic way of react, jsx, and typescript. It also included the way of deploying it into the `gh-pages`.

## Build and Deployment

There's a built deployment in the package.json. These following steps are written before pushing and deploying changes.

When the versions or task have been done.

- `yarn predeploy`
- `yarn deploy`

Then you can start to commit and deploy changes.

## CI / CD

The environment is depending on the `gh-pages`. Sooner I will make a `CI.yml` in `GitHub Actions` for the future test using `jest`.
